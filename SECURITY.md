## Solution

SOFARPC uses Hessian serialization by default. Hessian is a binary serialization protocol. For more information, please refer to Hessian's [documentation](https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-hessian).

Because of the implement of Hessian, by constructing a specific serialization stream, it may cause arbitrary code execution when doing deserialization. It is recommended that users configure blacklist to solve the problem.

SOFARPC also provides a way to configure blacklists in `BlackListFileLoader`, you can override the blacklist configuration based on the code.

The blacklist built into the project comes from internal practices and external contributions, and is for reference only and is not actively updated, we do not assume any legal responsibility for this.
